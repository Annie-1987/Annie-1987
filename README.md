Hello, this is Lily Violet, or @Annie-1987 from California, USA. I like to program (also known as coding).
I'm currently learning Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligencee (AI) programming, and lot more of computer science topics.
I'm not beginner; while I'm not also very professional. However, I'm hoping to be an awesome programmer one day.
I wish you make me learn more; since I'm still a student who is still studying and learning.
Well, I think that's the best I could introduce you about me; bye!
